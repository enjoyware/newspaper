                    Weekend Getaways: Soak up the sun and culture of Albuquerque
                </h2>
             <div>

                   Albuquerque, New Mexico, has a lot to offer: natural beauty, 
                   rich culture, delicious food and activities you won’t find in 
                   other U.S. cities. But this sunny, charming destination can 
                   fly under the radar as tourists gravitate toward nearby Santa
                   Fe. They’re missing out. After spending a long weekend in 
                   Albuquerque, I was completely smitten and eager to recommend 
                   this well-kept secret to Seattleites in search of a 
                   convenient, affordable getaway.

                    Averaging 280 sunny days per year, the Duke City might be 
                    the perfect antidote to the Seattle cloud cover. In early 
                    spring, daytime temperatures are typically in the mid-50s to
                    60s. (Pack extra layers for when it cools off after the sun 
                    goes down.) Affordable nonstop flights from Sea-Tac to 
                    Albuquerque clock in at around three hours.

                    From flamenco lessons to snowshoeing to eating all the 
                    chili-inspired dishes, here’s how to make the most of a long 
                    weekend in Albuquerque.

                   Where to stay: Built in 1939 by Conrad Hilton, Hotel Andaluz (hotelandaluz.com) 
                   is a charming boutique hotel located in downtown Albuquerque.
                   Be sure to explore the artwork on the second level. Rotated 
                   quarterly, all of of the pieces are by local artists and 
                   available for purchase. Eat dinner at MÁS — Tapas y Vino 
                   (hotelandaluz.com/mas-tapas-y-vino/) at least once. The shared 
                   plates are delicious and you’ll definitely want to save room 
                   for dessert — I highly recommend asking the chef to roast 
                   s’mores at your table. A historical property that reopened in
                   July, El Vado Motel (elvadoabq.com) originally opened its 
                   doors in 1937 and was one of the first motels on the famous 
                   Route 66. Don’t be dissuaded by the word “motel”; El Vado has
                   been completely refurbished and the rooms are charming, clean
                   and well-decorated. Grab a beer at El Vado Tap Room and chat 
                   with the friendly locals who frequent the bar — they’re more 
                   than happy to share tips and recommendations.

                    Local activities: Take in the sights of Albuquerque and eat 
                    some seriously delicious food on the Flavors of ABQ Bike Tour 
                    with Routes Bicycle Tours & Rentals (routesrentals.com). My 
                    favorite stops were Pop Fizz (pop-fizz.net), where I sampled 
                    ice-pop flavors including cucumber chili lime and mango red 
                    chili, and Sushi King, where I devoured about five New Mexico 
                    rolls.
